excerpt: "If you’re a student or someone who takes notes a regular basis, you may be interested in a fun and even artistic movement called Sketchnoting. Sketchnoting is like notetaking, but it includes visual notes as well as words. It’s a way of conceptualizing ideas, information, and other data on paper (or a digital tablet) beyond the traditional text medium of outlining."

I spend a lot of time and figuring out the best way to take notes, but I’d never heard of Sketchnoting before.

If you’re a student or someone who takes notes a regular basis, you may be interested in a fun and even artistic movement called Sketchnoting. Sketchnoting is like notetaking, but it includes visual notes as well as words. It’s a way of conceptualizing ideas, information, and other data on paper (or a digital tablet) beyond the traditional text medium of outlining.

Sketchnoting, or visual notetaking, is for clustering information and capturing big ideas. But if you think Sketchnoting is only for artists, it’s not. Sketchnoting is not about creating artwork per se, it’s about making notes visible and memorable with simple basic drawing skills. I’ve spent a few days learning about Sketchnoting, and I want to share with you what I’ve discovered so far.
